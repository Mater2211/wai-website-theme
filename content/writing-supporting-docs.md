At WAI, we sometimes have (sets of) documents that do not require the full WAI website wrapper, but we want them to look like WAI documents. 

These are commonly “supporting documents” for our accessibility standards, like the Techniques and Understanding documents for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## How to use the “supporting documents” layout

In the document's front matter, add:

```yaml
layout: minimal
```

## Other front matter

Supporting documents also have a couple of specific front matter settings.

Note: these settings can also be set in the `_config.yml` file for the whole project. For instance, in the repository that contains all ACT rules, the front matter that is shared between documents can be set in the `_config.yml` file .

### Navigation

To add links to the top navigation, add the `name` and `ref` attributes for each link in a `supporting_doc_nav_links`

```yaml
supporting_doc_nav_links:
  - name: All Objectives
    ref: /objectives
  - name: All Patterns
    ref: /patterns
  - name: About this Design Guide
    ref: /about
```

### Name for the set of documents

The name of the set of documents can be set in `supporting_doc_name`. For instance, for WCAG 2.1 Techniques, use: 

```yaml
supporting_doc_name: WCAG 2.1 Techniques
```

Some documents may have a long name which needs to be separated into two parts. Use `supporting_doc_name_sub`, to specify text that can be displayed smaller underneath.

```yaml
supporting_doc_name: "Design Guide"
supporting_doc_name_sub: "for People with Cognitive Disabilities and Learning Difficulties"
```

### Name of the type of document

To specify the type of guidance, for instance “Technique”, “ACT Rule” or “Design Pattern”, use: 

```yaml
type_of_guidance: Technique
```

This is displayed above the title of the document, and used to decide which sidebar to use.

## Different sidebars 

The supporting document template displays different sidebars based on the `type_of_guidance`. 

Currently, specific sidebars are supported for: 

- `Pattern` - for COGA Design Guide
- `Test Rule` - for ACT Rules

## Examples

For demo purposes, find below examples of supporting documents:

* [Test Rule](demo-act) (from ACT Conformance Rules)
* [COGA Design Pattern](demo-coga) (from COGA Design Guide)
