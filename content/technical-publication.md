Publishing the WAI Website is a series of mostly manual steps that ensure no data is overwritten unintentionally.

## 1. Generate Site Files

There are two ways to generate the site. 1.1 shows how to do it on GitHub, 1.2 shows how to render it on your local machine. 1.1 is the preferred method to deploy the site. Pick either one and then jump to [2. Copy Generated site to CVS Directory](#copy-to-cvs).

{% include excol.html type="start" id="simple" open="true" %}

### 1.1 Generate Using GitHub Action (Simple)

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

#### 1.1.1 Create a Release on GitHub

Visit the [Draft Release page](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/releases/new) to create a release. Enter today’s date into the “Tag Version” input field, in the format: `YYYY/MM/DD`. – This creates a nice organization of the files.

In the event of having multiple releases on one day, the format should be `YYYY/MM/DD-#` with # replaced by a number, counting up from 1.

No need to click anything else apart from the “Publish Release” button.

This process starts a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/create-release.yml) which – at the time of writing – automatically performs the following steps:

1. Check out repository
2. Update external resources
3. Commit the updated resources to the repository (if any)
4. Builds the site into the `_site` folder
5. Creates a zip archive of that folder
6. Attaches that zip archive to the release

**Note:** This could expand to link checking (which I experimentally tried but was taking too long and did not produce useful results) or spelling/grammar checking.

You can follow the generation of the files in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/actions) on GitHub. Once the generation is done (after about 6–9 minutes), reload the release (from the [releases page](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/releases)) and you can find that a `build.zip` has been attached to the release:

{% include image.html src="technical-publication-release.png" alt="" %}

**Download and extract the zip file and continue with [2. Copy Generated Site to CVS Directory](#copy-to-cvs).**

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

{% include excol.html type="start" id="complicated" %}

### 1.2 Generate Site on Your Machine (More Complicated to Setup)

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}


**Note:** The following steps were tested on a Unix machine. If you want to generate the website on Windows, using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is probably the way to go, albeit untested.

#### 1.2.1 Locally Clone & Set Up the Repository

The steps in this step 0

Clone the repository to your local computer to build. For example, the following command would clone the repository to your home folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:w3c/wai-website.git ~/wai-website
```

Then go to your checked out version of the site:

```bash
cd ~/wai-website
```

then install bundler:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

And install the dependencies. This step with bundler makes sure that everyone has the same versions of Jekyll & Plugins:

```bash
bundle install
```

(Yes, the application is called `bundler`, the command is `bundle`.)

Then, you also need to initialize the submodules:

```
git submodules init
git submodule update --remote
```

#### 1.2.1 Update Submodules

Submodules are links to the individual resources. `wai-website` is our main repository and individual resources like `wai-people-use-web` are then linked to as submodules.

The main repository keeps the structure of the website and then pulls the content from the individual resources.

Please ensure that you have the current version of the repository downloaded. So in your clone of the repository (for example in `~/wai-website`) run:

```bash
git pull
```

Then update the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --remote && git add _external && git commit -m "Update Externals" && git push
```

This code does four things: It updates the submodules, adds them to a commit, locks that commit in and pushes it back to the server.

#### 1.2.2 Build Site

Occasionally the bundler code is outdated or stops working, in that case run a `bundle update` in the repository folder.

Afterwards, build the site:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build --config "_config.yml,_config_prod.yml" --incremental
```

This command takes a couple of minutes to run. It outputs certain warnings that can be ignored:

```bash
Invalid theme folder: _sass
WARNING: skipped symlink /private/var/folders/br/73fx4d5s7dbb0j18tqdt6hfh0000gn/T/jekyll-remote-theme-20190924-62884-9cxak3/_data/lang.json
WARNING: skipped symlink /private/var/folders/br/73fx4d5s7dbb0j18tqdt6hfh0000gn/T/jekyll-remote-theme-20190924-62884-9cxak3/_data/techniques.yml
WARNING: skipped symlink /private/var/folders/br/73fx4d5s7dbb0j18tqdt6hfh0000gn/T/jekyll-remote-theme-20190924-62884-9cxak3/_data/translations.yml
WARNING: skipped symlink /private/var/folders/br/73fx4d5s7dbb0j18tqdt6hfh0000gn/T/jekyll-remote-theme-20190924-62884-9cxak3/_data/wcag.yml
```

The generated site is then output in the `_site` sub directory, for example in `~/wai-website/_site/`

{% include excol.html type="end" %}

## 2. Copy Generated Site to CVS Directory {#copy-to-cvs}

You can now copy all changed files from the `_site` to your checked-out CVS directory. **Important note:** Do not overwrite the directories in the CVS directory as they contain (sometimes hidden) CVS folders with _critical_ meta information.

**Merge the files into the CVS directory carefully.**

Some file managers have ways to help you with it, for example here’s a screen shot of the macOS software Forklift:

The screen shot shows two columns, on the left the source directory, on the right the target directory, shown are only files that changed. This would also show files that are added to the target directory. Deleted files are deliberately not shown as the W3C/WAI directory has hundreds of files not included in the `wai-website` repository. Those files should not be removed.

In the event of having a page deleted, the publisher needs to go into CVS **by hand** and delete that file. Otherwise it **will remain online**.

### Signs of When the Merge Would Break the Site

* Unless the template has changed, if all files are shown as new/to be replaced, you probably did not compile with the `_config_prod.yml` file added to the configuration.

## 3. Commit to CVS

**Make sure that your copy of the files in `WWW/WAI` is up to date.**

Use the command line or a CVS client of your choice to commit the added/updated files to the server. The following screen shot shows the macOS software SmartCVS.

It is set to show only modified and new files from all sub directories to make committing easier.

{% include image.html src="technical-publication-cvs.png" alt="" %}

You can add a commit message.

{% include image.html src="technical-publication-cvs2.png" alt="" %}
